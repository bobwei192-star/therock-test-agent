### Suggestion Description

In nearly all subprojects eveery submake gets $DASH_JAY as flag, which resets make's jobserver and makes it pissed off, you can see it in the logs. 
Could you restrict this CLI-Option  to the most top-level call builds run more smooth.
Also could you implement, thats if DASH_JAY is set by user in  shell, it won't be overwritten by your scripts.
In my case, I want to restrict the build to eight threads, to have some cpu-threads are availiable to the OS and the desktop, but it's regularly overwritten by the build-scripts with "-j 12".
