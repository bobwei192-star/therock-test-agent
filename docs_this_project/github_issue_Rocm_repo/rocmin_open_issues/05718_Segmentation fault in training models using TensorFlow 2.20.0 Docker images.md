Training models `tf2_tfm_resnet50_fp16_train` and `tf2_tfm_resnet50_fp32_train` might fail with a segmentation fault when run on the TensorFlow 2.20.0 Dockerimage with ROCm 7.1.1. As a workaround, use TensorFlow 2.19.x Docker image for training the models in ROCm 7.1.1. This issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release.
