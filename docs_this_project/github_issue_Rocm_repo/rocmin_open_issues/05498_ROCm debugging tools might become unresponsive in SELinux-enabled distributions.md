Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and related distributions automatically enable a security feature named Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which may prevent ROCm debugging tools, such as ROCgdb, ROCdbgapi, and ROCR Debug Agent, from working correctly.
 
The problem occurs when attempting to debug a program that contains code that runs on the GPU. The debugging session might become unresponsive while attempting to reach a breakpoint or executing instruction-stepping in device code. ROCgdb will still be responsive and accept interruptions by pressing `Control+C`, but the breakpoint in device code won't be hit, and the instruction-stepping operation will not be completed.
 
The ROCR Debug Agent might also become unresponsive when attempting to capture data from a program that is experiencing queue errors, memory faults, or other triggering events.
 
For a detailed workaround, see the [Installation troubleshooting](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux-internal/en/latest/reference/install-faq.html#issue-10-rocm-debugging-tools-might-become-unresponsive-in-selinux-enabled-distributions) documentation. This issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release.
