Due to limitations in older `libdrm` libraries, you might not be able to use an AMD Instinct MI300 series GPUs with a display GPU on a single server. This limitation means there can only be a maximum of 64 DRM devices at any time, regardless of vendor. When attempting to initialize all DRM device modules, the kernel will PANIC on the 65th DRM device, resulting in a system reboot. This issue will be properly fixed when resolved in `libdrm` libraries and the Linux kernel, to be distributed by the OS per their release schedules. Remove the non-AMD Instinct MI300 series GPUs as a workaround, or add the following in the GRUB setting for the onboard modules.

```bash
modprobe.blacklist=$MODULE
```
For Example:

* For Aspeed, use:
```bash
modprobe.blacklist=ast
```
* For Mellanox, use:
```bash
modprobe.blacklist=mgag200
```
