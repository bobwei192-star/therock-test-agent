### Suggestion Description

around line 423 of amdgpu-install, there's a case matching that checks if OS ID matches `ubuntu|linuxmint|debian)`. The installer has worked flawlessly on PopOS with a simple adding of `pop|` to the front of that line since time immemorial. Adding it officially would remove a roadblock for introductory users, removing the need to manually hack install scripts to make it work.

I understand this would require testing on the part of your developers, but it is a relatively simple fix and given that PopOS has as much of a Ubuntu base as Linux Mint, there's no reason it wouldn't work.  PopOS is gaining momentum as a gaming-focussed distribution, so this seems reasonable.

### Operating System
