### Problem Description

Hey everyone,

I recently tried downloading the entire ROCm ecosystem but for some reason my gpu isn't being detected (I think). I'm a bit of a beginner to this so any help is appreciated. Just as a summary, I have a 9060 xt 16 gb and I'm trying to download the latest software (7.0.2) on WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows 11.  I'm not sure if this version can run on WSL2, but if it can't can anyone let me know the latest version I can run?

wsl --version output:
WSL version: 2.6.1.0
Kernel version: 6.6.87.2-1
WSLg version: 1.0.66
MSRDC version: 1.2.6353

DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.26100.6899

### Steps to Reproduce

I followed all the instructions from these [docs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/detailed-install.html).

Prerequisites: 
I used group membership for configuring permissions for GPU access.

Installation Methods:
I went with the installation via native package manager. 

Post-Installation:
I configured ROCm using Option A: update-alternatives. I can see the packages are installed but when I do the following commands it gives errors:

rocminfo:

hsa api call failure at: /longer_pathname_so_that_rpms_can_support_packaging_the_debug_info_for_all_os_profiles/src/rocminfo/rocminfo.cc:1304
Call returned HSA_STATUS_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES: The runtime failed to allocate the necessary resources. This error may also occur when the core runtime library needs to spawn threads or create internal OS-specific events
