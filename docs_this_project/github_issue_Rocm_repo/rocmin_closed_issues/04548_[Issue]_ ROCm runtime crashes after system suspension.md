### Problem Description

Hey everyone!

Recently, I created a simple Mandelbrot fractal generator using GPU kernels. The generator was originally written in CUDA C and then converted to HIP code using the `hipify-clang` tool. After that, I compiled the final binary with `hipcc`, and everything worked fine. The program runs as expected and is highly efficient!

The problem occurs when I suspend my computer. When I first run the program after booting the system, everything works perfectly. However, if I suspend the machine, wake it up, and then try to run the program again, the system crashes. The process becomes unresponsive, and if I attempt to abort it using Ctrl + C, my machine completely freezes, forcing me to force shut down. I recorded a video demonstrating exactly this (please forgive my terrible English—I'm still working on it 😅): [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/MRfmHzUqkGY).

I remember that when I first installed ROCm, my machine already struggled with system suspension. After waking up, the screen would flash frantically. The "solution" to this was changing my battery mode from "Balanced" to "Performance" ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/1hk5wmi/fedora_41_screen_blinks_and_turns_off_when_waking/) is the post I read about this "fix"). After switching to Performance mode, the flashing screen issue disappeared, but now the screen brightness is set to maximum every time the computer wakes up from suspension, and the ROCm runtime breaks as described above. Perhaps this is a driver issue?

Thanks in advance for any help!

### Additional Information

I'm using the 6.8.0-57-generic linux kernel, and the code for the fractal generator I created can be found [here](https://github.com/Equiel-1703/mandelbrot-fractal).

**UPDATE**: I tried the 6.11.0-21-generic kernel, but I got exactly the same issues.
