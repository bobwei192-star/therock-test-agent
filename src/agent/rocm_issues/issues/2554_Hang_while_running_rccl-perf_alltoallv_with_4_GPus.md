## 描述

When RCCL is tested on a machine with no XGMI, a hang is observed while running rccl-perf alltoallv with 4 GPus.
As a workaround, set the value of the variable to 2 while running the tests,

NCCL_MAX_P2P_NCHANNELS=2

This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.
