### Problem Description

I'm using the default ComfyUI SDXL workflow with Ubuntu 24.04 and the proprietary AMD drivers. This is also the case using Fedora 42.

Issues:
- Using the default launch settings, the generation crashes with OOM errors
- Using tweaked settings, generation passes but is very slow

Results:

Clean Ubuntu 24.04 installation
AMD proprietary drivers
Python 3.10.17
Pytorch nightly
ROCm 6.4.1

```
export TORCH_COMMAND="--pre torch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-triton-rocm --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.4"

python ./main.py
```

@Matthew-Jenkins, appears to make no difference unfortunately:

With (baseline):

```

I also tried to use the MIGraphX node however it either doesn't work with SDXL or there is an issue with my configuration. Raised an issue on their repo: https://github.com/pnikolic-amd/ComfyUI_MIGraphX/issues/5

9070 support wasn't added until 6.4.1. You'll have problems until pytorch nightly updates to use it. the hsa override can make it run as if it is a previous generation card. 

The next thing to try is the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION . Try 
MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=2 HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0

if that doesn't work then try

MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=2 HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0

Until pytorch updates to 6.4.1 you will not get any benefit from the ai cores. But once it does you can expect about 1.2TFLOPs for i4 ops.

Thanks for the tips

> Try `MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=2 HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.0.0`
> if that doesn't work then try `MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=2 HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0`

Just tried both of these, unfortunately no luck there.

> Until pytorch updates to 6.4.1 you will not get any benefit from the ai cores. 

Ah, well that's good news. Will keep an eye out on pytorch's progress

I tried your commit with SDXL and VAE Decoder (Tiled) stills performs much worse than it used to on my old gpu(6700). Is that the same on your end?

Flag used: --use-pytorch-cross-attention

Edit: Never mind, had to turn off the experimental feature. But somehow the output image is gibberish with weird circular patterns.

Edit2: Using the newest torch from torch instead of amd fixed the weird circular patterns issue.

For convolution workloads winograd solvers in miopen would help a lot, I asked about those here https://github.com/ROCm/MIOpen/issues/3750. Another issues is that GEMM  tuning for gfx1201 for seems to not be optimal by default for some workloads. And probably few other areas that could improve.

With ComfyUI changes I mentioned, `TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` and pytroch install from https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-6.4.1/ it should work "reasonable", meaning there are still a lot performance left on the table, but it's not completely broken anymore...

Using https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipBLASLt/en/latest/how-to-use-hipblaslt-offline-tuning.html can increase perf 2x in some cases.

I'm having the same problem using pytorch-rocm with Chainner.
With my 6800XT, an inference took 17 while the same takes 28 seconds with 9070XT.

Hey @kasper93, regarding this:

> and pytroch install from https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-6.4.1/ it should work "reasonable"

Are there docs on how to install PyTorch from here? 

I have no idea what `pip install` is doing or how Python resolves its dependencies so I don't know how to pick the archives and manually reproduce the `pip` installation. I've been using the `pip3 install` command from pytorch.org, which I assume installs the packages into some global packages folder in the venv folder. Do you just download & extract the archives there?

I tried the following but that doesn't work:
```
pip3 install https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-6.4.1/pytorch_triton_rocm-3.2.0%2Brocm6.4.1.git6da9e660-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Also, how do I know that ComfyUI is using those packages rather than the previously installed ones from pytorch.org?

Apparently, PyTorch [just added support for ROCm 6.4.1](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/155292#issuecomment-3012269688) but either I am installing it wrong or it doesn't appear to make any difference.

@alshdavid: Keep expectations low, it's still slow in general. It works, but it seems you have overenthusiastic expectations for it.

See my comment https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4846#issuecomment-2952494361

Also, if you workload is only SD, AMD recently updated migrapx node for comfyui. https://github.com/pnikolic-amd/ComfyUI_MIGraphX after compiling the model with it, you will get significantly higher perf, which may meet your expectations.

> Are there docs on how to install PyTorch from here?

https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/install/native_linux/install-pytorch.html

But if upstream nightly pytorch support current version of rocm, you can use that directly.

### 评论 #14 — alshdavid (2025-08-08T02:13:39Z)

Not directly related but I just tried ComfyUI under Windows + latest HIP + Zluda on my 9070xt and performance is about the same as ROCm under Linux.

Generating an SDXL image with 1024x1024 resolution and 20 steps takes ~31 seconds (same as ROCm under Linux).

No OOM errors though, which is nice.

### 评论 #15 — Loacoon1 (2025-08-08T19:07:07Z)

So this is also a Windows issue and not necessarily Rocm related?! 
I'm honestly amazed at how bad software support is when it come to AI. The cards were released months ago now. Clearly this is my last AMD GPU....

> So this is also a Windows issue and not necessarily Rocm related?!

This occurs both on Windows and Linux. [This thread](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5040) has some interesting insights. It also looks like [running an LLM using a Vulkan backend](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pYciYq_qcFo) on the 9070xt shows a lot of potential so there's reason to be optimistic.

Looks like the ROCm 7.0 RC1 was cut a few hours ago so here's hoping that improves things. If I figure out how to install it (installing AI tools is madness) I'll report back. 

> Clearly this is my last AMD GPU....

I go back and forth on this too. I daily drive Linux and AMD GPUs have the best Linux support - otherwise I'd have gotten an nvidia 5080. It's quite frustrating that AMD's support for their own AI APIs is so poor. 

The recent "AI Max" APU with up to 96gb of ram sounds perfect for low cost/power efficient local LLM inference and perhaps even training/fine-tuning however it doesn't even support ROCm. It literally has AI in the name and can't run any AI workloads.

### 评论 #17 — Loacoon1 (2025-08-09T05:00:34Z)

Well FSR4 is not officially supported yet... DLSS4 is... so..... But yeah, AMD performs better than NV on Linux.  Still, this shouldn't happen! AMD promised much better performances with 9000 series for AI workloads and it's actually worse than previous gens and even makes the display server crash after LOTS of stuttering.

Hello,

I've 0 knowledge on how this work but I can give the workaround that worked out for me.

In comfyUI use the following nodes https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU

Completly restart the server

In you workflow use comfyui-multigpu VAE loader and setup the VAE device on the cpu...

I went from 560 seconds VAE decode on the GPU (_and whole computer is stuttering like a 2000's PC try to read a 4K movie_)
to a smooth 35/40 second for VAE decoding on CPU. (its the speed for 2 pics in 1024 res)

I have just tried installing ROCm 7 beta on Fedora 42 via the RHEL repos and retried generating a 1024x1024 image with SDXL on ComfyUI.

Relatively easy to install:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qDlHpeTmC0
https://gist.github.com/B4rr3l-Rid3r/b03460860f2841144135c0fe8bede5be

....And it appears to perform identically to ROCm 6.4 on Linux. So no performance improvement and still slower than my 6900xt 🙄

### 评论 #20 — dragonwise10 (2025-09-10T11:22:55Z)

Thank you for sharing your detailed analysis and benchmarks! I'm experiencing almost identical performance issues with my 9070XT in WSL - also getting around 30-31 seconds for 1024x1024 SDXL generation with 20 steps, which matches your results exactly.

It's somewhat reassuring to know this appears to be a common issue rather than something specific to my setup. The consistency of our results suggests this is indeed a broader compatibility or optimization problem that will likely require AMD's attention to resolve.

I appreciate you taking the time to document and report this issue. Hopefully AMD can address these performance concerns in future ROCm updates, as the 9070XT should theoretically perform much better than what we're currently seeing.

### 评论 #21 — Matthew-Jenkins (2025-09-10T13:01:21Z)

I'm interested in side by side benchmarks for the rx 9070 xt with rocm vs vulkan. If anyone could submit benchmarks with the same model but different quants, f16, q8, q4, iq4 that would really be very interesting to me. I've been on the fence to buy a 9070 to replace my 6900 xt.

---

### 评论 #22 — alshdavid (2025-09-10T21:05:11Z)

I'm also interested in Vulkan benchmarks too. I've seen some LLM perform incredibly well on the 9070xt under Vulkan which gives me hope. 

I've been trying to compile Pytorch to use a Vulkan backend but haven't been able to figure out their build process. The Vulkan backend is normally used for Android devices but IMO it would be helpful for getting GPU acceleration on under/unsupported devices (RDNA4, Strix Halo APUs, Intel GPUs, Snapdragon GPUs, etc).

I raised an issue on the pytorch repo asking them to release officially supported prebuilds of pytorch with a Vulkan backend https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/160230#issuecomment-3186343745

### 评论 #23 — Loacoon1 (2025-09-10T21:11:56Z)

IMO it would just be a placeholder anyway. 9000 series have dedicated AI capabilities that should, if software support wasn't abysmally bad, make them much faster than using Vulkan.
At that point I'm just considering selling my card and going back to team green. The release was 6 months ago! It feels like a bad joke considering that part of the marketing of these cards was based on their AI capabilities, but they are still basically unusable.

---

### 评论 #24 — alshdavid (2025-09-10T22:16:58Z)

What makes matters worse is my experiments with ROCm 7 doesn't seem to improve performance on my 9070xt. So much potential in these cards to kick ass but it doesn't look like we will see that materialize in the next 6 months.

I thought about switching to team green too but the 5080 doesn't seem worth the money with only 16gb RAM. In the meantime, I've been renting an Nvidia-powered VPS for ML workloads on-demand. It's like 60 cents an hour.

If the 5080 TI/Super comes out with 32gb then it's a no brainer

Vulkan shaders already run on the AI cores.

20 steps, same workflow/config as the other tests. I tried to get the MiGraphX node working but had no luck unfortunately.

90% of the time is spent in VAE decoding, getting around 4-5 it/sec

First render takes 500 seconds. When I change models first render takes 500 seconds. When I change image sizes the first render takes 500 seconds.

Also I'm occasionally getting this error:

Reviews and independent tests show Vulkan beating ROCm by a wide margin, which is insane because it's generic code versus kernels optimized by the manufacturer itself. AMD needs to fix this. 

It makes me wonder if there isn't anyone testing in realistic scenarios, on products that consumers actually use.

After a few hours of experimenting with different flags, I haven't found a way to stop the memory related crashing.

Performance is ok if you're generating `768x768` or `768x512` images. Around 3s per generation. Anything higher and the OOM errors either crash the generation or crash Windows.

Imagine if the 9070xt shipped with 32gb of RAM - that would hide this error for most use cases 😝

If the Nvidia 5080 super/ti has 32gb of RAM, AMD better watch out - I would probably jump ship at that point.

Yeah, same. 6 months and no decent software support. It's a very bad joke.

 Simply use `--disable-smart-memory`

and

add two lines in the file main.py in ComfyUI folder (Create a backup before!):

```
import torch
torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False
```

in where it belong to:
```
{}".format(args.oneapi_device_selector))

    if args.deterministic:
        if 'CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
            os.environ['CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG'] = ":4096:8"

    import cuda_malloc

if 'torch' in sys.modules:
    logging.warning("WARNING: Potential Error in code: Torch already imported, torch should never be imported before this point.")

import torch
torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False

import comfy.utils

import execution
import server
from protocol import BinaryEventTypes
import nodes
import comfy.model_management
import comfyui_version
import app.logger
import hook_breaker_ac10a0
```

With two workarounds combined:

No more OOM, can use VAE Decode normally, it's fast and smooth. No more heavy stuttering, extremely slowdowns during KSampler et cetera. The weirdest unstable memory management was gone as well. It was affected both on Windows and Linux, whatever which pytorch ROCm I use:
pytorch ROCm 6.4 Nightly for Fedora 42 WS (via official pytorch website)
pytorch ROCm 7.0.0 experimental for Windows 11 Pro (for the console outpot see below.)
Both ComfyUI ROCm installied via Stability Matrix App.

Disabling Smart Memory Management wasn't enough to solve everything at once. I had to go deeper for the long & blind trial-and-error until I've found an another culprit: torch.backends.cudnn.enabled

I am not a programmer/developer. Just a casual gamer. So I don't know what the last one meant for. Google Search never helped me in any way, neither Google Gemini or other assistants. I was on my own for the full time and blindly searched any websites like GitHub, Reddits and more until noticed one thing without any further explanation: torch.backends.cudnn.enabled

Google Gemini suggested me to add these lines in file main.py and ran ComfyUI for the experiment. A success!

It's the pure ComfyUI out of the box experience with pure basic workflows only.
Zero third party nodes
Zero modifications and more.
Zero special arguments for HIP, PYTORCH, MIOPEN etc.
Et cetera.

Other arguments used: --normal-vram --preview-method auto --use-pytorch-cross-attention --disable-xformers (and the added --disable-smart-memory )
FP16 by default depends on.

--disable-smart-memory is something I have to use even on my rx 6900 xt. I think comfys smart memory just does not work on amd. Disabling smart memory makes it so it doesn't try to move things in and out of gpu memory. It either all fits or it doesn't.

no sure if anyone had this same experience but using stuff like --use-pytorch-cross-attention, PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1 or TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 causes extremely lengthy workflow load, without any of that it loads/runs extremely fast... running with python 3.12 as its the same version packed with my system's rocm7 install

### 评论 #37 — ghost (2025-10-11T14:28:34Z)

Right, link after link i ended up here. As suggested above, using --disable-smart-memory and adding import torch & torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False to main.py solved all the stalling issues i had. Any resolution works fine and quick now, not only a few odd ones.

Linux Mint, 7900 XTX, ROCm 7.0. All working fine now!

I have tested the latest released driver for ROCm 7.1 on Windows, with the latest version of ComfyUI, all generations are working without stack overflow, without using `--disable-smart-memory` and using PyTorch cross attention on RX 9070 XT.

For Z-Image FP8, I can generate images 1024x1024 at 1.4it/s.
For SDXL, I can generate images 1024x1024 using Euler normal at 5it/s.

### 评论 #44 — mordekai2025 (2025-11-28T19:28:54Z)

It's because of `Set: torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False for better AMD performance.` on ComfyUI's startup. I can generate SDXL images as well at 4.21 it/s with my RX 9070 on Windows. With PyTorch cross attention. So it didn't change much on my side. I'm still waiting for a proper fix.

@jammm The issue I had with the driver crashing is no longer happening, however, when I try to generate a big resolution image (+1700px on height or width), the system becomes slow and stutters at the VAE step, but I can work around it by using a tiled VAE, but it doesn't crash, hopefully this issue is fixed too

If you try to generate a larger image, it would exceed the VRAM and go into shared memory. That would explain the slow perf. As for the stuttering, that's probably happening because the GPU is being fully utilized across all shader cores. This is especially visible if you have youtube playing in the background for example. Tiled VAE helps because the tile sizes are small enough to fit within VRAM.

By default on ComfyUI was `Set: torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False for better AMD performance.` I can generate images with SDXL, Pony and more normally with normal VAE decode.

After editing the file comfy/model_management.py with the specific lines to `Set: torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = True for testing :)`
SDXL Image can not be generated anymore as it's stuck at KSampler at 1024x1024
Same for other models like Pony and others. Can't get everything past. Hm...

I can't test Flux, WAN, AuraFlow and more on both states of CUDNN (enabled and disabled) so I am out of my testing possibilities as it didn't simply compute anything beyond that point. Stuttering or causing black screen and freeze (had 3x recently).

During the installation of ComfyUI via Stability matrix, it took the latest ROCm libraries specially made for gfx120x GPU like my Radeon RX 9070 16GB.
That was on Windows 11 Pro x64 and Adrenaline 25.9.1 WHQL. Stability Matrix using the latest stable version as well. ComfyUI v0.3.76 Stable.

Gonna test on Fedora Workstation Linux to investigate the behaviour.

### 评论 #58 — jammm (2025-12-05T14:09:01Z)

@mordekai2025 I would not recommend `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = True` for now. There's a good reason it was disabled, and that's because the VAE decode involves 3D convs which aren't supported yet for navi GPUs, so it would end up calling naive convs which are extremely slow.. So it's highly recommended you keep `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled = False`.

There's work ongoing in MIOpen that should fix this so we can eventually re-enable it. But it shouldn't be enabled for now.

Does this only happen when you try running larger resolutions? As for the crash, what's the errors you see? Is it memory access fault?

look here for workarounds and fixes: https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5833 , https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4742

Using those fixes i can generate faster than RTX 4080 and RTX 5070 Ti in comfyui flux image generation.

SD1.5 runs at 24 it/sec. at 512x512, SDXL at 15 it/sec.at 512x512, flux-dev 1.02 it/sec at 1440x810, flux2_fp8 4.24 s/it at 1440x810.

Benchmark example for RTX 4080 Super: https://civitai.com/articles/8309/flux1-fp16-vs-fp8-time-difference-on-rtx-4080-super-in-comfyui

Example for 9070 XT: My Prompt, flux-1-dev_fp8, 2 LoRAs, 1440x810, 42 steps, euler, simple, upscale with lanczos to 3840x2160 takes 46.80 seconds. 

Direct apples-to-apples: Prompt and seed from benchmark link above: flux-dev with fp8, 1024x1024, 40 steps, euler, simple, no upscale takes 34.42 seconds.

RTX 4080 Super: flux-dev with fp8,1024x1024, 40 steps, euler, simple, no upscale takes 44.04 seconds.

10 seconds faster than RTX 4080 Super.

RX 9070 XT: Prompt and seed from benchmark link above: flux-dev with default weight type, 1024x1024, 40 steps, euler, simple, no upscale takes 45.64 seconds. (model weight dtype torch.bfloat16)

RTX 4080 Super: flux-dev with fp16,1024x1024, 40 steps, euler, simple, no upscale takes 66.75.

That is 21 seconds faster than RTX 4080 Super.

Generation speed varies a bit. If you generate more images and switch the weigths around, generation gets a bit faster. The latest image i generated was 26.01 seconds, benchmark settings, default weight type, 20 steps. The image after that, the 3rd image, only takes 23.76 seconds. -> RTX 4080 Super: 37.53 seconds.

I downloaded the flux1-dev.safetensors file because my flux-dev.saftensor file i used above is several years old. After further debugging i found a another flux workflow in the examples and i got these results using my updated settings https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5833#issuecomment-3718504872 :

<img width="2560" height="1197" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35b7e8c8-0d31-4e30-85eb-5b2233eb0598" />

Regarding this phrase from the benchmark i posted before:

> Note: Each test excludes the time taken to load the model. The reported generation times refer only to the time within kSampler.

He only wrote down the sample times. The time values i posted are for the complete worklow including everything. Look at my posted images, you can see the ksampler time in the terminal in the lower right corner.

Ok so, since I got time I tried your settings.
One positive note, inference time is more stable.
As for the rest, well it's horribly slow.
With you settings, 3:35 to 3:40, without them, first inference at 2:35, others between 65 seconds and 1:40 minutes.
Fan speed with your settings 650RPM, without 1500RPM. 
Seems like the GPU is waiting for the CPU as a thread is always maxed out.
So no, no miracles here.

EDIT: I've been making some tests and I actually owe you an apology. Only one export caused that issue. When removed, it actually works pretty fine. A constant 66 seconds for the inference which is about 15 seconds faster than the RTX5060TI 16GB.
In case someone has the same issue here is the culprit:
export MIOPEN_CHECK_NUMERICS=0x02
Just remove it, and everything will work as intended.
Now, let's just hope that it doesn't crash the whole system at some point since this OTHER issue doesn't seem to be resolved.

EDIT2: It works on some models, not others. Changing the model, the crashes are even more frequent as well as slow inference. 

EDIT3: The 'export PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED="1"' is causing the crashes with no gain in speed whatsoever. It can safely be removed. With that, it seems stable, but some models are as fast as expected, others remain quite slow, though not as slow as without these settings, and the duration is much more stable. Overall it's a win, but we're still waiting for a real fix, that seems to have been put very low on the priority list. I mean, how urgent can "things not working" be? Right AMD?

----------------------------------------------------

How this works:

----------------------------------------------------

Speed optimization:

Using the above settings for 

export MIOPEN_FIND_ENFORCE=3

and 

export MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=6

and

export PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="1"

will result in a very slow generation on the first run. Usually i set these and then startup comfyui. In the default startup workflow just hit the "RUN" button. You will generate SD1.5 images, the first one can take quite long. When it is finished swap the model for any SDXL model and hit run again. When finished both SD1.5 and SDXL is optimized. 

You can then open another workflow. 

I will usually then continue with the flux-dev fp8 workflow and let that run once or twice. After that i load up flux-dev workflow and do the same there. After that i load flux.2 fp8 workflow, it is called "product mockup Flux.2 fp8" in the templates. 

All of these need to run once to get optimised for fastest image generation. And that can take a loooong time, really.

After you ran all your needed workflows once go to the comfyui console and close the server by pressing CTRL+C.

Speed optimization is now done for the models and image sizes you just ran.

-------------------

Then open your comfyui startup script to edit it once more.

Set

export MIOPEN_FIND_ENFORCE=1

and

export MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=2

and

export PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="0"

This will set these variables to the fastest possible setting i found so far.

Startup the server again with the altered script will get you faster startup times for image generation.

The thing is as soon as you use a model you have not used before with FIND_ENFORCE=3 and FIND_MODE=6 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="1" it will take longer on the first run. Entering a different image size than the one you optimized will get you a longer first run.

If you want to optimize another workflow you have to set FIND_ENFORCE=3 and FIND_MODE=6 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="1" again and let those run in addition to the other workflows. Then set FIND_ENFORCE=1 and FIND_MODE=2 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="0" again to get more speed.

--------------------------

You will lose your optimization data if you update to a newer version of Pytorch. In that case you have to repeat the optimization.

--------------------------

You will lose your optimization data if you keep FIND_ENFORCE=3 and FIND_MODE=6 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="1" AND restart the ComfyUI server.

In that case optimization has to be repeated. Only use those values for the optimization, then stop the server and set those to FIND_ENFORCE=1 and FIND_MODE=2 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="0" for the fastest possible speed.

----------------------------

Example:  The first image SD1.5 in optimizing stage takes 1166 seconds for the full image. The second image takes 0.92 seconds, the third image 0.87 seconds. Using the same default workflow i just switch the model to SDXL. First image takes 7.91 seconds, second image 1.25 seconds, third image 1.25 seconds. Now the default workflow with SD1.5 and SDXL is optimized for the default image size of 512x512.

Flux1 is much slower on the first image. It usually takes about 2 hours for the first image to appear, Flux2 is even slower, can take almost 3 hours for the first image. But when optimized it is very fast afterwards. Then stop the server, edit the script to FIND_ENFORCE=1 and FIND_MODE=2 and PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING="0" and restart. Now you have the optimized speed right at the beginning of your session and it stays that way. In my case it got even faster after generating more images of different sizes and using loras on top. However all your optimizations will be lost when you upgrade pytorch and you have to edit the script again and start optimizing again.

Example picture from optimizing flux.2-fp8 model:

<img width="2559" height="1139" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd1d6e98-fdfb-4e3d-86b5-5b59a6cc7ce1" />


The first image took 5178 seconds to complete, second image 296 seconds, third image 284 seconds. Then in switched the weight type from "default" to "fp8_e4m3fn_fast". This sped up the VAE econding. The fourth image took 122 seconds, the fifth 83 seconds, sixth image 118 seconds. And that is only because i already had optimization data from the previous torch version i used. If you start it up after a fresh installation it will take almost double the amount of time. It almost eats up my whole memory. 90 GB of 96 GB is being used and all available GPU memory too by ComfyUI.

-------------------------------

On my system and SD1.5 i started with about 24 it/sec some weeks ago. Now with optimized settings and new kernel 6.18.9-201 it runs at 28 it/sec. SDXL 15 it/sec went up to around 18 it/sec.

--------------------------------------

Using "--disable-smart-memory" results in a memory leak. On each consequential run in flux1 workflows for example the usable memory displayed when generating a new image will be reduced by a small amount leading to a "HIP out of memory" error eventually.

Another variable i found is the browser you use for ComfyUI. I tried the official Firamdgpu.queue_preemption_timeout_ms=1efox browser from the Nobara/Fedora repo and i got frequent crashes using ComfyUI. Then i switched to the ESR version of the Firefox browser and those crashes are gone since then. Turning off hardware acceleration in the browser settings helped further to prevent crashes.

Installed it with snap:

 sudo dnf install snapd

sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap

sudo snap install firefox --channel=esr/stable

Reference:

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/firefox-esr-for-fedora/79871

-------------------------------------------------

If you are still crashing you should debug with a new terminal running "sudo dmesg". If you get errors they will display there at the end of the output in RED colour. Using the new kernel is still unstable but a bit faster on my machine. To run ComfyUI without any crashes i still have to use kernel version 6.17.12-200. There are warnings still present in my dmesg output in BLUE colour.

-------------------------------------------------

After more testing i found that setting "export HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0" converted all of my errors into warnings on the latest Nobara kernel 6.19.5-200 and the crashes are gone.

With the latest Kernel 7.0.0-200 i removed the kernel option "amdgpu.queue_preemption_timeout_ms=1" to prevent hangs and garbled output. After some testing it still crashes with the new kernel as well. Kernel 6.19.5-200 works but i still kept kernel 6.17.12-200 to run comfyui because it just works perfect. There are even minor image generation speed updates which i think are related to the updated graphics drivers.

-------------------------------------------------

Testing new Kernel parameters:

amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0  iommu=pt

I deleted the other kernel parameters mentioned above. With the latest updates to Nobara Linux 43 and ComfyUI and my trusted kernel 6.17.12-200 the image generation with Flux2 got faster from 3.80 sec/it to 2.90 sec/it.

I _believe_ this is what _mostly_ stopped my O.S. from locking up, but I've been testing several environmental variables as well so I'm not sure yet. My system still _often_ stuttered heavily during certain parts of most, if not all, the ComfyUI workflow I tried. If I tried to do things while it was stuttering, especially making any windows full-screen, that seemed to increase the chances of a system lock-up substantially. That was mostly tested with `--reserve-vram 0.2` and `--use-flash-attention`. The (tiled) VAE decode was still taking a very long time, but the directions in the comment cited below seem to have resolved that (so far). Both the `--disable-smart-memory` and the code change were necessary-- neither helped independently. I have yet to confirm whether the stuttering behaviour and risk of lock-up have reliably changed.

Also, for the record, a lot of us really appreciate what A.M.D. is doing for the open-source community. Having perfect software and firmware when new products launch would obviously be ideal but just the fact that we're here talking about this is a solid step above Nvidia in my opinion. I'm also satisfied with my card's current performance, although I do hope it continues to improve with updates.

You could lower the core count used by comfyui running your workflows. Using these variables:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=12
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=12
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=12

Works good on my machine with 16 cores and for a Ryzen 9 3900 X 12 core cpu i just set those to 10. However with the latest Nobara Kernel 7.0.0-200 it hangs and stutters a lot. Kernel 6.17.12-200 works perfectly fine and i can open steam or using my broswer as usual while generating pictures with Flux1 and Flux2. Especially Flux2 is very resource demanding and uses a lot of RAM too.

### 评论 #76 — Penguin-Guru (2026-04-24T05:36:33Z)

@RadeonVega-56 

Yes, I have borrowed those values. It seems like V.A.E. decoding sometimes only uses a single core for some reason, but I don't think that's what was causing the stuttering. Sometimes the python process also maxes out one core even when no workflow is running until I restart ComfyUI, which is obviously a bug but does not cause any stuttering. Since disabling smart memory (and cudnn/MIOpen) helped, I'm guessing the stuttering might be caused by G.P.U./V.RAM bandwidth or something like process management. I haven't tried using a different G.P.U. It might be that the lock-ups have been resolved and only the video stutters and freezes now (with smart memory and MIOpen enabled. I also haven't tried to manually tune resource limits for the ComfyUI/python system processes. Hopefully [this](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/2591) helps. I'll probably continue fiddling with the environment variables a bit but I think I'm getting decent performance with MIOpen and smart memory disabled for now. I will try to confirm whether that memory leak is also occurring on my system when I have a chance.

Have you tried L.T.X. 2.3? This is one of the models that was causing the V.A.E. decoding issue most often.

LTX 2.3 runs perfect. I can do up to 15 seconds 720p at 30 fps in 15 minutes.

I generated videos all day long. I can do 30 sec 720p at 20 fps in almost 1 hour. :D
