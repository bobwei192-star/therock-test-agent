### Summary

`amdgpu_gem_object_open` creates / refcounts a `bo_va` **before** calling `amdgpu_eviction_fence_attach`. If the fence attach fails (it can return `-ENOMEM` from `dma_resv_reserve_fences` under host RAM pressure), the failure path returns without undoing the `amdgpu_vm_bo_add` / refcount bump. The orphan `bo_va` lives in `vm->va` for the lifetime of the `amdgpu_vm` and `vm->stats[domain]` is leaked by 1.

User-visible signature is the `dmesg` line every Linux ROCm user sees if they leave a long-uptime box running short-lived GPU clients (Discord renderer, browser tab churn, etc.):

```
amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: VM memory stats for proc Discord(28374) task Discord:cs0(28320) is non-zero when fini
amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: VM memory stats for proc (0) task (0) is non-zero when fini
```

The cumulative leak eventually exhausts the GPU's VM-range table; the next sustained workload (ComfyUI, llama.cpp, anything with high CS-submission rate) gets a flood of:

```
amdgpu 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* Not enough memory for command submission!
```

and the system freezes until reboot. In our test box, this occurred consistently around 25 hours of uptime.

### Root cause

`drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_gem.c::amdgpu_gem_object_open`, ~line 300:

```c
amdgpu_vm_bo_update_shared(abo);
bo_va = amdgpu_vm_bo_find(vm, abo);
if (!bo_va)
    bo_va = amdgpu_vm_bo_add(adev, vm, abo);   /* +1 vm->stats */
else
    ++bo_va->ref_count;

r = amdgpu_eviction_fence_attach(&fpriv->evf_mgr, abo);
if (r) {
    amdgpu_bo_unreserve(abo);
    return r;                                   /* leaks */
}
```

### Fix

Reorder: attach fence first; only mutate `bo_va` after success. Pure reorder under the same `amdgpu_bo_reserve` window.

### Test status

- 25-hour soak post-patch on RX 9070 XT: zero `is non-zero when fini` entries (previous boots: 3–10/24h).
- Failure-injection (`failslab`) test not yet run — straightforward to add if upstream wants quantitative coverage.

### Environment

- AMD RX 9070 XT (RDNA4, gfx1201, 17.1 GB VRAM)
- AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, 32 GB DDR5
- Linux 6.17.0-1020-oem (Ubuntu 24.04 / Mint 22.3)
- DKMS `amdgpu/6.18.4-2286447.24.04` (release 31.10), ROCm 7.2.3
- Userspace: routine desktop (Cinnamon, Firefox, Discord, Steam, ComfyUI, llama.cpp)

Mirroring this to gitlab.fd.o/drm/amd issues for the kernel maintainers.

Hi @Deaththegrim, thanks for reporting this issue! I have checked our source code & change list, this is actually resolved in our development branch and will be available to 6.19 dkms on next release.
