## 描述


## TL;DR

On a Bosgame M5 (Sixunited AXB35-02 board, AMI BIOS 1.07 / 2025-09-12), every PyTorch/HIP workload that loads a sizeable model into `cuda:0` reproduces a non-recoverable HSA fault:

```
Memory critical error by agent node-0 (Agent handle: 0x...) on address 0x7f.... Reason: Memory in use.
```

The crash fires at `hsaKmtFreeMemory` of a 4 KB host-mapped page allocated on node 1 during HSA queue/scratch setup. **Software is fully exhausted**: 4 kernels (incl. mainline 7.0.1 with KFD ABI 1.22), 4 ROCm versions (incl. stable 7.2.2), 5 HSA env-var levers, 8 kernel cmdline variants, two firmware revisions, two BIOS UMA settings, two containers (incl. AMD official `rocm/pytorch:rocm7.2.2`). A simple `hipMalloc/hipMemset/hipDeviceSynchronize/hipFree` cycle works; only the model-load pattern fails. ~~llama.cpp + ROCm runs end-to-end on the same GPU with identical kernel/firmware.~~ *(Edit 2026-04-27: corrected — my llama.cpp here is Vulkan RADV, not ROCm; see What works section.)* Filing because the matrix is now tight enough to be diagnostic.

## Hardware

| | |
|---|---|
| Mini-PC | Bosgame M5 (BeyondMax Series) |
| Mainboard | Sixunited AXB35-02 |
| SoC | AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 w/ Radeon 8060S (Strix Halo) |
| GPU target | `gfx1151`, 40 CUs, wavefront 32 |
| RAM | 128 GB unified |
| BIOS | AMI 1.07 / 2025-09-12 (Bosgame has shipped no updates since launch) |
| BIOS UMA "Dedicated Graphics Memory" | 0.5 GB (also tested 64 GB — same crash) |
| Secure Boot | disabled |

The same physical board (AXB35-02) is rebadged by GMKtec as the EVO-X2, which has BIOS v1.12 (2025-12-09) — community-confirmed safe for cross-flash on Bosgame M5 ([strixhalo.wiki AXB35 firmware page](https://strixhalo.wiki/Hardware/Boards/Sixunited_AXB35/Firmware)). I have not cross-flashed (yet); leaving that as a separate hardware-side variable.

## Software stack

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Fedora 43 Workstation |
| Kernel | `7.0.1-262.vanilla.fc43.x86_64` (`@kernel-vanilla/stable` Copr) |
| KFD ABI | MAJOR=1, MINOR=22 (`/usr/src/kernels/.../include/uapi/linux/kfd_ioctl.h`) |
| Mainline kernel fixes confirmed in tree | b42f3bf9 VGPR save-restore, 71776e0965f9 CWSR export, 7a5fb05b ABI 1.20→1.22 |
| firmware | `linux-firmware-20260110-1.fc43` (also tested 20260309) |
| Kernel cmdline | `rhgb quiet iommu=pt ttm.pages_limit=32505856` (also tried with `amd_iommu=off`, `amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0`, `amdgpu.sched_policy=2`, `amdgpu.vm_fragment_size=9`, `amdgpu.gttsize=126976`, `amdttm.*`, `ttm.page_pool_size`) |

**ROCm userspace stacks tested (all crash identically):**
- AMD official `docker.io/rocm/pytorch:rocm7.2.2_ubuntu24.04_py3.12_pytorch_release_2.10.0` (2026-04-15) — torch 2.10.0+rocm7.2.2.git40d237bf, hip 7.2.53211
- TheRock nightly `kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-comfyui:latest` — torch 2.11.0a0+rocm7.12.0a20260211, hip 7.3.53390
- TheRock pinned `7.11.0a20260106`
- Direct `repo.radeon.com` torch wheel `2.10.0+rocm7.2.0.lw.gitb6ee5fde`

## Symptom

```
:0:rocdevice.cpp:... Memory critical error by agent node-0 (Agent handle: 0x...) on address 0x7f.... Reason: Memory in use.
```

Reproduces in any process that loads a transformer-style text encoder or large UNet onto `cuda:0`. Consistent across:
- **WAN 2.2 ti2v 5B fp16 (Q5_K_M GGUF)** at 512×384×17 frames — fires at `Requested to load WanTEModel` (the umt5-xxl text encoder)
- WAN 2.2 i2v 14B fp8+fp16
- SeedVR2 video upscaler (any size)
- Flux 2 dev (fp8 mixed + bf16 Mistral)
- Plain `torch.zeros(N, dtype=torch.float32, device='cuda:0')` for any N **once the process has done some prior `cuda` work, in some cases** — but see "Negative" below

Non-recoverable: HSA runtime can't free more memory after, process effectively dead.

## What works

- **`hipMalloc(64 MB) + hipMemset + hipDeviceSynchronize + hipFree`** on kernel 7.0.1 (KFD ABI 1.22) — passes cleanly. Source:
  ```c
  #include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
  #include <cstdio>
  int main() {
    void *p; hipError_t e;
    e = hipMalloc(&p, 64*1024*1024); printf("hipMalloc: %s\n", hipGetErrorString(e));
    e = hipMemset(p, 0, 64*1024*1024); printf("hipMemset: %s\n", hipGetErrorString(e));
    e = hipDeviceSynchronize(); printf("sync: %s\n", hipGetErrorString(e));
    hipFree(p); printf("OK\n"); return 0;
  }
  // hipcc t.cpp -o t --offload-arch=gfx1151 && ./t  →  OK
  ```
  This same reproducer crashed identically on kernel 6.18.5 (KFD ABI 1.18). The kernel-side ABI bump fixed the simple allocator path.

- **Synthetic torch alloc loops** in a fresh process — pass:
  ```python
  for size in [64*1024*1024, 256*1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024, 5*1024*1024*1024]:
      t = torch.zeros(size//4, dtype=torch.float32, device="cuda:0")
      torch.cuda.synchronize()
      del t; torch.cuda.empty_cache()
  ```
  Also: 200 iterations of `4096×4096 fp16` matmul + free + empty_cache in 1.6s, no crash.

- **llama.cpp + Vulkan RADV** — runs Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL end-to-end on this same GPU, no crashes. Vulkan path only, no HIP exercised. *(Edit 2026-04-27: original report incorrectly said "llama.cpp + ROCm" — build here is `GGML_HIP=OFF / GGML_VULKAN=ON`. I have not verified a HIP-built llama.cpp on this hardware. The implication "distinct HIP allocator path from torch's" therefore does not follow from this data point.)*

- **sd.cpp Vulkan** — runs Flux 2 / WAN 2.2 GGUF end-to-end. Confirms hardware + power + VRAM partitioning are healthy.

## Failing trace (`AMD_LOG_LEVEL=4 AMD_LOG_MASK=0x60000 HSAKMT_DEBUG_LEVEL=7`)

Full trace at `comfyui_extended_trace.log` (192 lines, kernel 7.0.1 + ROCm 7.12 nightly), attached. Failing sequence at `Requested to load WanTEModel`:

```
[hsaKmtAllocMemoryAlignCtx] node 1 address 0x7f0417800000 size 2101346304 from device
[hsaKmtMapMemoryToGPUNodesCtx] address 0x7f0417800000 number of nodes 1

Memory critical error by agent node-0 (Agent handle: 0x560304d08f00) on address 0x7f091de3f000. Reason: Memory in use.
```

**Object identity**: the failing 4 KB page on node 1 is allocated `from host` early in HSA queue setup. Best matching candidate from rocr-runtime sources: `AqlQueue::pm4_ib_buf_` (4 KB, AllocateExecutable via `system_allocator()`) — but `HSA_ALLOCATE_QUEUE_DEV_MEM=1` did not change behavior, so it's either not pm4_ib_buf_ or that env var is not honored in either of the userspace builds tested. CWSR is documented as a related setup region but **disabling CWSR at the kernel level (`amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0`) does not fix the crash**, so the CWSR teardown is correlation, not causation.

## What's been ruled out (so we don't have to round-trip)

**Kernels** (all crash):
- 6.18.3-200.fc43 (last known-good per pytorch#173367)
- 6.18.5-200.fc43 (ChristianKniep's working baseline on his Framework)
- 6.19.12-200.fc43
- **7.0.1-262.vanilla.fc43 (KFD ABI 1.22)** — the libhsakmt warning `gfx1151 requires KFD ABI ≥ 1.20` is silenced; same crash

**Kernel cmdline** (none change behavior):
- `amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0`
- `amdgpu.sched_policy=2` (no MES HWS)
- `amdgpu.vm_fragment_size=9`
- `amdgpu.gttsize=126976`
- `amdttm.pages_limit=32768000` + `amdttm.page_pool_size=32768000` + `ttm.page_pool_size=32768000`
- `amd_iommu=off` (and conversely `iommu=pt` alone)

**HSA env vars** (none change behavior; tested via `kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-comfyui` on kernel 7.0.1 — `AMD_LOG_LEVEL=4` IS honored so at least some env vars reach the runtime):
- `HSA_ALLOCATE_QUEUE_DEV_MEM=1`
- `HSA_DISABLE_FRAGMENT_ALLOCATOR=1`
- `HSA_ENABLE_INTERRUPT=0`
- `HSA_ENABLE_SCRATCH_ASYNC_RECLAIM=0` + `HSA_NO_SCRATCH_RECLAIM=1`
- `HSA_MAX_QUEUES=1`
- `HSA_USE_SVM=0` + `HSA_ENABLE_SDMA=0`
- `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1` (and unset)
- `HSA_XNACK=1`
- `PYTORCH_HIP_ALLOC_CONF=backend:native,expandable_segments:True,garbage_collection_threshold:0.9,max_split_size_mb:512`

**Container privilege** (no change):
- rootless podman with `--device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add 39 --group-add 105`
- `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt label=disable`
- **`--privileged`** (falsifies the sdnext#4652 IOMMU/DMABUF hypothesis)

**Firmware**: 20260110 vs 20260309 — same crash on both.
**BIOS UMA**: 0.5 GB vs 64 GB — same crash on both.

## Negative / non-trigger

- The crash does **not** show "Memory access fault by GPU agent on address X / Page not present" — that's the #6118/#6146 class which the kernel-side fixes addressed. We are not in that class.
- `dmesg` is **clean** during the crash — no GPU VM faults, no ring resets, no KFD errors. Failure is entirely userspace-visible from the HSA runtime.
- Synthetic `torch.zeros(...)` and the 15-line `hipMalloc/Free` pure C reproducer pass on kernel 7.0.1. The crash is gated on the specific HSA queue/scratch setup pattern that PyTorch + ComfyUI's `model_management.load_models_gpu()` triggers when uploading a transformer text encoder or UNet.
- This is the same hardware that ChristianKniep ran WAN 2.2 T2V-A14B on successfully on 2026-01-16 with kernel 6.18.5 — BUT his hardware was a different OEM (Framework). Filing supports a board/BIOS-class delta hypothesis.

## Closely related but distinct tickets (please correlate, not duplicate)

| Ticket | Status | Why it's not this |
|---|---|---|
| ROCm/ROCm#6118 (`hsa_queue_create causes GPU page fault on gfx1151`) | closed | Different signature ("Page not present"), fixed by kernel `cwsr_size`/`ctl_stack_size` export which IS in this kernel |

| ROCm/ROCm#5824 (`gfx1151 segfault`) | closed 2026-01-23 | Closed for inactivity; original reporter still saw issues post-FW upgrade |
| ROCm/TheRock#2991 (canonical gfx1151 VGPR fix summary) | closed 2026-02-23 | Userspace `hsakmt: Expose and use CWSR and Control stack sizes` shipped in TheRock Dec 19 2025+; we've tested that build; it fixes simple alloc but not this signature |
| sdnext#4652 (`Memory critical error by agent` on Bazzite Strix Halo) | open | Reporter fixed via `--privileged`; we tested `--privileged`, no effect — IOMMU/DMABUF hypothesis falsified for this hardware |
| pytorch/pytorch#173367 (`Strix Halo HSA crashes 6.18.4+`) | open since 2026-01-26 | Profile matches but the kernel-version differentiator they describe (6.18.3 vs 6.18.4) does not apply here — both crash |
| ROCm/rocm-systems#2200 (`hsakmt: Expose and use CWSR and Control stack sizes`) | merged | The userspace part of the fix that #2991 tracks; in the wheels we've tested |

## Questions / requests for triage

1. Is the failing 4 KB host-mapped node-1 page identifiable from the trace alone — pm4_ib_buf_ or something else? Does AMD have a known list of HSA queue setup objects that allocate `from host` on node 1 in this size?
2. Is `node-0` the CPU agent, or a separate GPU partition node? The error reports node-0 owns the in-use mapping while the alloc/unmap/free were on node 1.
3. Has any AMD engineer correlated bugs against AMI BIOS 1.07 / Bosgame M5 / Sixunited AXB35-02 specifically? GMKtec EVO-X2 (same physical board, BIOS 1.12) reports are absent from this signature in our search; if AMD has internal data showing this is BIOS-version-gated, that would close the case.
4. Is there a flag combination — kernel cmdline, HSA env, SMU/IOMMU policy — that we have NOT tried that's known to bypass the HSA queue setup pattern shown in the trace? Particularly anything that would change whether a 4 KB allocation lands `from host` vs `from device` on node 1.
5. Should we cross-flash GMK 1.12 BIOS as the recommended diagnostic, or RMA?

Hi @dkzv! I'm on a similar setup (Minisforum ai-server, Ryzen AI MAX+ 395, 128GB RAM). I noticed you mentioned that llama.cpp runs end-to-end for you on ROCm without crashes, while I'm getting constant [gfxhub] page fault (PERMISSION_FAULTS: 0x3) even with -dio and iommu=pt.

Could you please share:

- Which specific ROCm version/libraries are you using?
- What is your llama.cpp build (version/commit)?
- Your exact kernel version (uname -a) and any specific amdgpu module parameters?
- Are you using a specific Docker image or running bare-metal?
- Your working configuration would be a lifesaver for the community. Thanks!

### 评论 #2 — dkzv (2026-04-27T15:27:05Z)

That line in the issue body is wrong, my working llama.cpp is Vulkan RADV, not ROCm (editing the body now). So I can't speak to the HIP path, but here's the Vulkan setup that works end-to-end if it's useful as a fallback:

- llama.cpp commit `23b8cc499` ("version: 8838"), bare-metal cmake: `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DGGML_HIP=OFF -DGGML_NATIVE=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
- Runtime: `AMD_VULKAN_ICD=RADV`
- Flags: `-ngl 999 -fa on --no-mmap --no-context-shift --ctx-size 262144 --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0 --batch-size 2048 --ubatch-size 512`
- Model: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` (~22 GB)
- Mesa `25.3.6-3.fc43`, vulkan-loader `1.4.341.0`
- Kernel `7.0.1-262.vanilla.fc43.x86_64`, cmdline: `iommu=pt ttm.pages_limit=32505856 amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0 amdgpu.sched_policy=2`
- Bare-metal user systemd unit, no container

Your `[gfxhub] PERMISSION_FAULTS:0x3` is a different fault class than the HSA "Memory in use" here.

### 评论 #3 — valeriy-idatica (2026-04-28T09:17:12Z)

Thanks for the clarification, @dkzv! That explains the PERMISSION_FAULTS I was seeing with the HIP path. Since ROCm is still a bit of a moving target on Strix Halo, your Vulkan (RADV) success is a great roadmap.

I'm currently on Ubuntu 24.04 with Kernel 6.8, so seeing your Fedora/Kernel 7.0 and Mesa 25.3 setup is very helpful for context. I'll try replicating your GRUB parameters (especially ttm.pages_limit) and Vulkan flags to see how far I can push my setup. Cheers!

### 评论 #4 — harkgill-amd (2026-05-01T13:50:26Z)

Hey @dkzv, thanks for the comprehensive report. I'd like to capture a couple different baselines so we can narrow down exactly what's failing here.

First and foremost, you mentioned workloads that loads a sizeable model into cuda:0 trigger the `Memory critical error`. Do you have a minimal reproducer that can consistently hit this? Does moving a single layer onto the GPU with something like `m = torch.nn.Linear(4096, 4096).cuda()` reproduce this or does the model have to be magnitudes larger in size? A strace log here would also be helpful to get a better idea of what went wrong right before the error's thrown, 

`strace -e ioctl -f -o trace.log <reproducer command>`

It might be a bit long but you should be able to drop it into your comment as an attachment. The last thing that'd help is a clean baseline on Ubuntu with ROCm 7.2.1 and the OEM kernel if possible - install instructions for both of these can be found [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/install/installryz/native_linux/install-ryzen.html#prepare-the-system).

@harkgill-amd  — results:

### 1. Minimal reproducer (Linear bisection)

`torch.nn.Linear(4096, 4096).cuda()` with and without `forward()` passes cleanly. Stayed clean scaling to width 16384 and depth 4× Linear(8192). What I found is more interesting than a clean threshold:

- **TE-equiv ~2.56 GB (emb 50k×4096 + 8× MLP blocks), no warmup → flaky hang at `.cuda()`.**
- **Same model + a 1 MB `torch.zeros` warmup before the move → 0.31s pass.**

Hang is race-shaped: at ~2.02 GB I got **1/10 hangs** over 10 fresh-subprocess runs. dmesg clean across both passing and hanging runs. Symptom is a silent hang (no HSA error message, just SIGTERM by timeout) — different surface from the `Memory in use` print but same "no kernel fault, userspace-only" class.

`repro_linear.py` + grid + flaky-d6 in the gist.

### 2. strace ioctl on the ComfyUI WAN ti2v 5B path

Reproduced the original signature at `Requested to load WanTEModel`:

```
Memory critical error by agent node-0 (Agent handle: 0x56097224d8a0)
on address 0x7fb8bb018000. Reason: Memory in use.
```

The KFD-relevant flow on the loader thread (TID 3015117) is just **24 ioctl lines**, full sequence:

```
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_AVAILABLE_MEMORY)           = 0    (×4)
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 1
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU)          = 0    map   1
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 2
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU)          = 0    map   2
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 3
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU)          = 0    map   3
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_CREATE_EVENT)               = 0
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 4
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU)          = 0    map   4
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 5
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU)          = 0    map   5
ioctl(4, _IOC(R|W, 0x4b, 0x20, 0x48))           = 0    AMDKFD_IOC_SVM (set attrs, 72B args)
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_CREATE_QUEUE)               = 0
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU)        = 0    alloc 6 (no map -- queue ring/scratch?)
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_FREE_MEMORY_OF_GPU)         = 0    (frees the SVM-args region)
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_SET_EVENT)                  = 0
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_DESTROY_EVENT)              = 0
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_UNMAP_MEMORY_FROM_GPU)      = -1 EBUSY    <<< FAILS
ioctl(4, AMDKFD_IOC_FREE_MEMORY_OF_GPU)         = -1 EBUSY    <<< FAILS
--- SIGABRT ---
```

So the kernel-side origin of the userspace `Memory in use` text is **`AMDKFD_IOC_UNMAP_MEMORY_FROM_GPU` returning `-EBUSY`** immediately after a `CREATE_QUEUE`, then `FREE_MEMORY_OF_GPU` also `-EBUSY`. Suggestive shape: alloc-6 has no MAP (queue ring/scratch?) and the SVM op right before CREATE_QUEUE may set an attribute that creates the refcount the later UNMAP trips on.

@harkgill-amd — Ubuntu baseline done. Same hardware crashes on the very first GPU dispatch, with a cleaner kernel-side fault signature than the Fedora surface.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Board | Bosgame AXB35-02 (BeyondMax Series) |
| BIOS | AMI v1.07, 2025-09-12 |
| GPU | gfx1151 — AMD Radeon 8060S (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395) |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| Kernel | `6.17.0-1020-oem` |
| ROCm | 7.2.1 (`rocm-core 7.2.1.70201-81~24.04`, ROCk module 6.16.13, HIP 7.2.26015) |
| PyTorch | `2.11.0+rocm7.2` (gfx1151 in `torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`) |
| XNACK | NO (per `AMDKFD_IOC_SET_XNACK_MODE` and rocminfo) |

Installed per [the official Ryzen AI install guide](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/install/installryz/native_linux/install-ryzen.html#prepare-the-system) you linked.

## What happens

`repro_torch_alloc.py` (the 64 MB / 256 MB / 1 GB / 5 GB `torch.zeros` smoke from the original report) reaches the first `torch.zeros(64MB, device='cuda:0')`. `hipMalloc` succeeds, the runtime loads the native gfx1151 fill kernel, launches it, and the GPU immediately page-faults. The Python process then hangs in HSA error handling at 99% CPU (no syscalls, flat RSS) and never returns.

### HIP runtime (excerpt)

```
hipMalloc ( ..., 67108864 )                           → hipSuccess
__hipPushCallConfiguration ( {16384,1,1}, {256,1,1} )
hipLaunchKernel ( ..., {16384,1,1}, {256,1,1}, ... )
hip_fatbin: Using native code object for device: amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx1151
:1:rocdevice.cpp:3327: Memory Fault Error
```

### Kernel (dmesg)

```
amdgpu 0000:c5:00.0: amdgpu: [gfxhub] page fault (src_id:0 ring:153 vmid:8 pasid:32773)
  Process python3 pid 16613 thread python3 pid 16613
  in page starting at address 0x00007e412d471000 from client 10
  GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS:0x00800932
    Faulty UTCL2 client ID: CPF (0x4)
    MORE_FAULTS:        0x0
    WALKER_ERROR:       0x1
    PERMISSION_FAULTS:  0x3
    MAPPING_ERROR:      0x1
    RW:                 0x0
```

The faulting client is **CPF (Command Processor Frontend)** with `WALKER_ERROR | MAPPING_ERROR | PERMISSION_FAULTS:0x3` — the page-table walker hit an invalid mapping while CPF was fetching the dispatch packet itself. **Reproduced four times** in this session (pids 15443, 15807, 16613, and one more) with identical fault status bits.

### KFD ioctl trace (summary, from `strace -e ioctl -f`)

```
 23  AMDKFD_IOC_ALLOC_MEMORY_OF_GPU
 23  AMDKFD_IOC_MAP_MEMORY_TO_GPU
  8  AMDKFD_IOC_WAIT_EVENTS
  7  AMDKFD_IOC_CREATE_EVENT
  4  AMDKFD_IOC_SET_EVENT
  2  AMDKFD_IOC_SET_MEMORY_POLICY
  2  AMDKFD_IOC_GET_PROCESS_APERTURES_NEW
  2  AMDKFD_IOC_ACQUIRE_VM
  1  AMDKFD_IOC_SET_XNACK_MODE
  1  AMDKFD_IOC_SET_TRAP_HANDLER
  1  AMDKFD_IOC_RUNTIME_ENABLE
```

ALLOC and MAP counts are balanced. **No `EBUSY` from `UNMAP_MEMORY_FROM_GPU` like in the Fedora trace.** The trace ends mid-burst of ALLOC+MAP pairs (scratch buffers being prepared for the first dispatch); the dispatch itself goes via mmap'd doorbell writes and isn't visible to `strace -e ioctl`.

## Compared to the Fedora surface

| | Fedora 44 / kernel 6.19.14 / TheRock 7.12 | Ubuntu 24.04 / OEM 6.17 / ROCm 7.2.1 |
|---|---|---|
| Userspace symptom | HSA `Memory critical error ... Memory in use` | HIP `Memory Fault Error` + Python hang at 99% CPU |
| KFD ioctl signal | `AMDKFD_IOC_UNMAP_MEMORY_FROM_GPU → -EBUSY` after `CREATE_QUEUE` | clean ALLOC+MAP pairs until SIGTERM by timeout |
| dmesg | clean (no GPU fault logged) | **CPF page fault** with `WALKER_ERROR \| MAPPING_ERROR \| PERMISSION_FAULTS:0x3`, ×4 |
| Phase | HSA queue setup during model load | First `hipLaunchKernel` (the fill kernel for `torch.zeros(64MB)`) |

Both surfaces fail at the very-first-GPU-dispatch / queue-bringup phase, on identical hardware. The Ubuntu kernel just logs the underlying GPU page fault directly where Fedora's KFD swallows it and only the userspace HSA "Memory in use" surfaces.

## Conclusion

Switching from Fedora 44 / linux-vanilla 7.0.1 (KFD ABI 1.22) / TheRock 7.12 to Ubuntu 24.04 / linux-oem 6.17 / ROCm 7.2.1 stable **does not change the failure**. The fault occurs in `GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS` with CPF as the faulting client on the very first GPU dispatch, regardless of OS or kernel.

This places the bug in the **hardware/firmware class** (Bosgame M5 / AXB35-02 BIOS, AMI v1.07, 2025-09-12), not the Fedora-kernel/KFD-ABI class.

The same `[gfxhub] PERMISSION_FAULTS:0x3` fault class was reported by @valeriy-idatica on a Minisforum ai-server (different vendor, also Strix Halo) — possibly the same root cause is reachable from multiple OEM BIOSes.

Thanks for getting the baseline with Ubuntu, this is very helpful. Narrowing it down to the same error as https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/6186 with fail signature
```
  GCVM_L2_PROTECTION_FAULT_STATUS:0x00800932
    Faulty UTCL2 client ID: CPF (0x4)
```
is a good step forward. I haven't been able to repro this on my end yet with the same configuration as what you've reported this on (Ubuntu 24.04 + 6.17.0-1020-oem + ROCm 7.2.1) though I do see a couple reports of this exact same failure internally. Working with those teams to isolate what the exact discrepancy is between failing and passing systems - once we have better picture of this we can get started with scoping out a potential solution. Will share any updates on the investigation in this thread.

EDIT - Do you have `amdpgpu-dkms` installed by any chance? The [7.2.1 installation for Ryzen](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/install/installryz/native_linux/install-ryzen.html#set-up-rocm-usecase) avoids amdgpu-dkms entirely as it can cause conflicts. For reference, I installed it just to get an idea of what the failure would look like and ran in to the exact same hangs with `Faulty UTCL2 client ID: CPF (0x4)` in dmesg reported. See https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/6143 for a similar issue that had this root cause as well.

Going to close this out for now but if you do get a chance to test with/without amdgpu-dkms, please leave a comment and I'll re-open this ticket.
