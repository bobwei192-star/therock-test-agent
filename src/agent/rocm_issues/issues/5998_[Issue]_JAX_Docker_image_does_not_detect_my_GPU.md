### Problem Description

I tried installing ROCm and pulling a JAX Docker image to run JAX code, following the instructions [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/jax-install.html). Running the test snippet to test the installation returns

```
[RocmDevice(id=0)]
Traceback (most recent call last):

... Stack trace here

jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError: INTERNAL: unable to find ld.lld in PATH: No such file or directory
```

It seems to run fine with Pytorch, so I feel somewhat confident that the ROCm install went OK.

Note: I observed the same issue as #4043, so I ran the same udev fix as was suggested there.

### Operating System

Ubuntu 24.04.4

### CPU

Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7600 CPU @ 3.50GHz. 

### GPU

AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT.

### ROCm Version

ROCm 7.2.0

### ROCm Component

_No response_

### Steps to Reproduce

_No response_

### (Optional for Linux users) Output of /opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo --support

Hi @yasharhon You mentioned that you ran the same udev fix as [#4043](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4043) was suggested, how about the result?

---

### 评论 #2 — yasharhon (2026-02-28T20:39:34Z)

@Michelle-HCJ  Seemed to work fine. I got the same error as the issue mentioned, and running the udev fix made the error not appear anymore. Note that everything is installed on my host OS, not in a container as in that issue.

ETA: For clarity, that solved the post-installation verification issues, not the issues running JAX.

Here's what I get when doing the post-install verification steps:

Hi @yasharhon, thanks for reporting this issue.

I am able to reproduce this with `rocm/jax:latest` following the instructions [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/jax-install.html#use-a-prebuilt-docker-image-with-jax-preinstalled), and running the tests:

```
python3 -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"
python3 -c "import jax.numpy as jnp; x = jnp.arange(5); print(x)"
```

The workaround is to run the following: `export LLVM_PATH=/opt/rocm/llvm`.

I can see this issue was fixed in the nightly built image [here](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax/actions/workflows/nightly.yml) after pulling it. However, these images built against ROCm 7.2.0 do not seem to be available to the public yet, hence why [only the 7.0.0 image is documented](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-images). I am currently inquiring about this.

You can find more of these images [here](https://github.com/orgs/ROCm/packages?repo_name=rocm-jax). If you have issues pulling them as per the above, let me know.

If you do try out `ghcr.io/rocm/jax-ubu24.rocm700:nightly` or any of the other images, you may run into https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax/issues/163. If so, workaround by running:

```
apt update
apt install libdw1
```

That issue is also fixed with the latest nightlies for ROCm 7.2.0. I will update this ticket further when both fixes are consolidated into the `rocm/jax:latest` image, which is what this issue is about.

Let me know if you have additional questions/concerns. Thanks!

@lucbruni-amd Thanks for getting back to me! It might take a few days before I'm able to run the test, unfortunately. I'll get back to you as soon as that's done.

Just to be clear:
- I only need to add the `LLVM_PATH` env variable? No other installation is needed?
- If that doesn't work with ROCm 7.2.0, the next step is to downgrade to 7.0.0 and follow the instructions using a nightly-based Docker image, as the fix should be in place for those?

Yes, this should workaround the first issue you encountered.

>If that doesn't work with ROCm 7.2.0, the next step is to downgrade to 7.0.0 and follow the instructions using a nightly-based Docker image, as the fix should be in place for those?

My apologies for the confusion in my message above. If you have no luck with the env variable above inside the `rocm/jax:latest` container, you can try the [nightly](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax/pkgs/container/jax-ubu24.rocm720). You can find a bunch of options [here](https://github.com/orgs/ROCm/packages?repo_name=rocm-jax).

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions or issues. Happy to help!

### 评论 #6 — yasharhon (2026-03-05T18:28:43Z)

@lucbruni-amd Finally got around to testing it, here are some findings:

- Changing `LLVM_PATH` did not fix anything on its own.
- The `LLVM_PATH` variable had the wrong value inside the (latest) JAX container.
- Updating the variables both in the container and on my host OS seems to have made JAX runnable, but I still get just one device.

I assume this means that the run was successful, given that JAX didn't crash this time. Is JAX also detecting my GPU, given that it finds a `RocmDevice`?

---

### 评论 #7 — lucbruni-amd (2026-03-11T15:20:55Z)

Yes, that means the run was successful. `RocmDevice` is JAX’s device type for AMD GPUs. So `RocmDevice(id=0)` should be your RX 9060 XT. Let me know if you have further issues/questions.

### 评论 #8 — yasharhon (2026-03-12T21:44:20Z)

No, that was it, this issue has been solved as far as I am concerned. Please update the documentation, though

### 评论 #9 — lucbruni-amd (2026-03-16T20:36:34Z)

The workaround of setting `LLVM_PATH` within the container should be sufficient on it's own. The steps I took to achieve this (following [this page](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/jax-install.html#use-a-prebuilt-docker-image-with-jax-preinstalled)):

```
$ docker pull rocm/jax:latest

# The docker run flags only give the container access to the GPU devices (--device=/dev/kfd, --device=/dev/dri), not the host’s filesystem.
# So the host’s /opt/rocm is not mounted; the container uses its own /opt/rocm and /opt/rocm-7.2.0.
$ docker run -it \
    --network=host \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --ipc=host \
    --shm-size 64G \
    --group-add video \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -v $(pwd):/jax_dir \
    --name rocm_jax \
    rocm/jax:latest /bin/bash

$ python3 -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"
[RocmDevice(id=0)]
$ python3 -c "import jax.numpy as jnp; x = jnp.arange(5); print(x)"

$ export LLVM_PATH=/opt/rocm/llvm

$ python3 -c "import jax.numpy as jnp; x = jnp.arange(5); print(x)"
[0 1 2 3 4]
```

>The LLVM_PATH variable had the wrong value inside the (latest) JAX container.

That's right. Verified this with:
```
$ docker run --rm rocm/jax:latest env | grep -i llvm
PATH=/root/bin:/root/.local/bin:/opt/rocm-7.2/opencl/bin:/opt/rocm-7.2/bin:/opt/rocm-7.2/hcc/bin:/opt/rocm-7.2//bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/rocm/bin:/opt/rocm/llvm/bin
LLVM_PATH=/opt/rocm-7.2/llvm

# ls -l /opt
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   22 Jan 21 21:07 rocm -> /etc/alternatives/rocm
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Jan 21 21:07 rocm-7.2.0
```

This shows the `rocm/jax:latest` image was built with an incorrect argument, causing `LLVM_PATH` to be incorrectly set (see https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax/blob/33fbb4bc8c3f59ba91b81a5a152fd17da1e09bf9/docker/Dockerfile.base-ubu24#L155). So this is not a documentation issue, we just have to make sure that `rocm/jax:latest` gets built correctly before it is shipped in conjunction with the next ROCm release. I'll keep this open until that happens.

Closing as this is no longer an issue in the latest image (7.2.3).
