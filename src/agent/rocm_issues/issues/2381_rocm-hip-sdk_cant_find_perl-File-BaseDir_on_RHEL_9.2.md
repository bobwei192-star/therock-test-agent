## 描述

Looks like the rocm-hip-sdk is having issues with the perl-File-BaseDir on RHEL 9.2 needed from "hipcc-1.0.0.50600-67.el9.x86_64" when trying to install 5.6

Looks like its there from trying to get file basedir from cpan as shown 

[arakendo@rhel-server ~]$ sudo cpan File::BaseDir
Loading internal logger. Log::Log4perl recommended for better logging
Reading '/root/.local/share/.cpan/Metadata'
  Database was generated on Tue, 15 Aug 2023 14:54:02 GMT
CPAN: Module::CoreList loaded ok (v5.20210320)
File::BaseDir is up to date (0.09).
[arakendo@rhel-server ~]$ sudo yum install rocm-hip-sdk
Updating Subscription Management repositories.

Error:
 Problem: package rocm-hip-sdk-5.6.0.50600-67.el9.x86_64 requires rocm-hip-runtime-devel = 5.6.0.50600-67.el9, but none of the providers can be installed
  - package rocm-hip-runtime-devel-5.6.0.50600-67.el9.x86_64 requires hipcc = 1.0.0.50600-67.el9, but none of the providers can be installed
  - conflicting requests
  - nothing provides perl-File-BaseDir needed by hipcc-1.0.0.50600-67.el9.x86_64
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
